#Simulation
There are a number of reasons why we need the ability to simulate the behavior of a control system.
* First of all, the behavior of a control system might be unintuitive or unfamiliar. To develop intuition for the abstract problem we can use simulations and thus get a better understanding of control problems that arise in the real-world.
* In most cases it is not possible to do extensive testing and experimenting on real-world machines. Often they are too big, too expensive, too expensive, too dangerous or simply not available. And if they are available, tests will mostly be too time consuming to conduct serious experiments. Therefore simulations will suit better.
* The most difficult part is to implement controllers, filters, etc. according to abstract concepts like *transfer functions*. Simulations can help with a better understanding and make these concepts more concrete.
* Finally, no control system will ever be put into production unless it has proven itself to function correctly. Therefore, simulations are not *just for fun*, but form a crucial step in the design of a feedback control system.

In this section of the wiki we will discuss a simulation framework that was built for this study. Also we will go over a number of case studies by using this framework.

##Time
One of the most important parts of the simulation framework is the simulation of time. For computer systems we are presented with a choice between two possible representations. We can use real time (also know as '*wall-clock*' time) where the controlled system evolves according to its own rules and dynamics, independent from control actions. In this case, control actions will usually occur periodically with a fixed time interval between two actions. Another choice is to use control time (also known as '*event time*'). Here the system does not evolve between two control actions, hence the time is synchronous with the control actions. Notice that this is the type of time that was used in the earlier examples.

In a simulation, the time is determined by the number of simulation steps. To convert this to a simulation of real time, we must assume that each simulation step has exactly the same duration (measured in real time). Therefore the steps in the simulation correspond to a certain duration in real time. Hence we need a conversion factor `DT` that translates simulation steps into real time durations.

##Simulation framework
In order to model every component in the simulation framework, we use a `Component` trait (or interface) containing two abstract functions: `update` and `action`. The former is used to iterate to the component's state in the *next* simulation step, based on its current state and an update parameter `u`. The latter is used to calculate the action that needs to be taken at in the *current* simulation step. To see what is going on inside a component, another abstract function `monitor` is provided that returns a `Map[String, AnyVal]`. This needs to be implemented on each component.

Furthermore it should be noticed that components can be concatenated in order to compose more complex components. In other words, `Component` can be viewed as a Monoid, hence the `++` operator. Also, we can implement `map` on a `Component` in order to apply functions to the output signal of a component.

```scala
trait Component[I, O] {
	def update(u: I): Component[I, O]
	def action: O
	def monitor: Map[String, AnyVal]

	def ++[Y](other: Component[O, Y]): Component[I, Y] = {
		val self = this
		new Component[I, Y] {
			def update(u: I): Component[I, Y] = {
				val thisComp = self update u
				val otherComp = other update thisComp.action
				thisComp ++ otherComp
			}
			
			def action: Y = other.action
		}
	}

	def map[Y](f: O => Y): Component[I, Y] = {
		val self = this
		new Component[I, Y] {
			def update(u: I): Component[I, Y] = self update u map f

			def action: Y = f(self action)

			def monitor = self.monitor
		}
	}
}
```

###Controller
Controllers convert the tracking error in a system input. As discussed before, the most common controller is the `PIDController`. Here `update` calculates the new integral and derivative components of this controller and returns a new instance with these new values, whereas `action` calculates the value of the control action, which serves as an input for the controlled system. Notice that here the earlier discussed `DT` factor enters the calculations twice.

```scala
class PIDController(kp: Double, ki: Double, kd: Double = 0.0, integral: Double = 0, deriv: Double = 0, prev: Double = 0)(implicit DT: Double) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(error: Double): PIDController = {
		val i = integral + DT * error
		val d = (error - prev) / DT
		
		new PIDController(kp, ki, kd, i, d, error)
	}

	def action = prev * kp + integral * ki + deriv * kd

	def monitor = Map("PID controller" -> action)
}
```

A more advanced implementation can be found in `AdvController`, which adds two features to `PIDController`. First it has a filter for smoothing the derivative term. Supplying a positive value `0 < s < 1` will result in applying a recursive filter on the derivative term. Furthermore a parameter `clamp` is added, which prevents *integrator windups*. This means that when the controller's output exceeds a certain limit (defined by `clamp`), the controller will not update its value during the next round.

Regarding the latter feature, this controller can be used to control a heating element. Here a lower bound can be set on 0Â° Celsius, since it is usually impossible for a heating element to produce negative heat flow.

```scala
class AdvController(kp: Double, ki: Double, kd: Double = 0, clamp: (Double, Double) = (-1e10, 1e10), smooth: Double = 1, integral: Double = 0, deriv: Double = 0, prev: Double = 0, unclamped: Boolean = true)(implicit DT: Double) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(error: Double): AdvController = {
		val i = if (unclamped) integral + DT * error else integral
		val d = smooth * (error - prev) / DT + (1 - smooth) * deriv
		
		val u = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * deriv
		val un = clamp._1 < u && u < clamp._2
		
		new AdvController(kp, ki, kd, clamp, smooth, i, d, error, un)
	}

	def action = prev * kp + integral * ki + deriv * kd

	def monitor = Map("Advanced controller" -> action)
}
```

###Filters and actuators
Besides controllers, we also might want to make use of other components. These are the actuators and filters. The most obvious one (`Identity`) just reproduces its input value and emits that as its output. This filter can be used as a default argument if in fact no filter is needed.

```scala
class Identity[A](value: A = 0) extends Component[A, A] {
	def update(u: A): Identity[A] = new Identity(u)
	
	def action = value

	def monitor = Map("Identity" -> action)
}
```

Another filter is the `Integrator`, which takes the sum of its inputs and returns its current value. Notice that since we are calculating an integral here and that therefore we need to multiply the sum by factor DT to convert from simulated steps to real time.

```scala
class Integrator(data: Double = 0)(implicit DT: Double) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(u: Double): Integrator = new Integrator(data + u)
	
	def action = DT * data

	def monitor = Map("Integrator" -> action)
}
```

Finally we present two smoothing filters. The first, `FixedFilter`, calculates the unweighted average of the last `n` elements.

```scala
class FixedFilter(n: Int, data: List[Double] = List()) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(u: Double): FixedFilter = {
		val list = (if (data.length >= n) data drop 1 else data) :+ u
		new FixedFilter(n, list)
	}
	
	def action = data.sum / data.length

	def monitor = Map("Fixed filter" -> action)
}
```

The second filter, `RecursiveFilter` is an implementation of the exponential smoothing algorithm. This adds the current value `u` to the previous filter output in order to return the current step's output.

```scala
class RecursiveFilter(alpha: Double, y: Double = 0) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(u: Double): RecursiveFilter = {
		val res = alpha * u + (1 - alpha) * y
		new RecursiveFilter(alpha, res)
	}
	
	def action = y

	def monitor = Map("Recursive filter" -> action)
}
```

###Convenience functions
Finally we introduce a number of convenience functions with the intention of hiding most of the boilerplate code. First we have a number of basic setpoint functions. These can be used as input for a feedback loop, but can also be composed to get a more complex setpoint function by multiplying the result of such a function with a scalar and/or adding with other functions.

```scala
object Setpoint {
	def impulse(t: Long, t0: Long)(implicit DT: Double) = if (math.abs(t - t0) < DT) 1 else 0

	def step(t: Long, t0: Long) = if (t >= t0) 1 else 0

	def doubleStep(t: Long, t0: Long, t1: Long) = if (t >= t0 && t < t1) 1 else 0

	def harmonic(t: Long, t0: Long, tp: Long) = if (t >= t0) math.sin(2 * math.Pi * (t - t0) / tp) else 0

	def relay(t: Long, t0: Long, tp: Long) = if (t >= t0 && math.ceil(math.sin(2 * math.Pi * (t - t0) / tp)) > 0) 1 else 0
}
```

Also we provide the boilerplate code for multiple types of loops. For now we discuss the `closedLoop` and come back later to other types of loops. This function is modeled after the extended version of a feedback control system, including the actuator and filter.

![Extended feedback control system](images/Feedback system - extended.png)

```scala
object Loops {
	def closedLoop[A](setPoint: Observable[A], seed: A, components: Component[A, A], inverted: Boolean = false)(implicit n: Numeric[A]) = {
		import n._
		Observable[A](subscriber => {
			val y = BehaviorSubject(seed)
			y drop 1 subscribe subscriber
			
			setPoint.zipWith(y)(_ - _)
				.map { error => if (inverted) -error else error }
				.scan(components)(_ update _)
				.drop(1)
				.map(_ action)
				.subscribe(y)
		})
	}
}
```

Notice that using the `closedLoop` function on a control system with controller, actuator, plant and filter will require using the `++` operator in order to concat these components.

###Running example
To demonstrate the workings of these basics, let's implement a simple `Plant` (this is the controlled system) and see how this framework performs. First we implement `Boiler`:

```scala
class Boiler(g: Double = 0.01, y: Double = 0)(implicit DT: Double) extends Component[Double, Double] {
	def update(u: Double) = new Boiler(g, y + DT * (u - g * y))

	def action = y

	def monitor = Map("Boiler" -> action)
}
```

Then we can use this plant to create a small example program. We first initialize the `DT` variable (default to `1.0`) and construct a `setpoint` function from one of the convenience functions as well as the time, plant and controller. Finally we put these all in the `closedLoop` function and print the result.

```scala
def simulation(): Observable[Double] = {
	implicit val DT = 1.0
	def setpoint(t: Long): Double = 10 * Setpoint.doubleStep(t, 10, 60)

	val time = (0L until 150L) toObservable
	val p = new Boiler
	val c = new PIDController(0.45, 0.01)

	Loops.closedLoop(time map setpoint, 0.0, c ++ p)
}
```

The results of running this example program will yield the following plot:
